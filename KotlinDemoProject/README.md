# Kotlin-FinalProject
Final project for the course Mobile Programming With Native Technologies

## Project overview
This mobile application allows users to search for movies from TMDB Api. Users enter the movie title as a search parameter. The application provides a list of all matching movies. Clicking on the movie opens a screen with
additional details. Due to the very short timeframe for creating the application, its functionality was intentionally limited. The main focus was on demonstrating my skills in creating a simple, well designed and neat mobile application using Kotlin and Jepack Compose.

## Tech stack
100% Kotlin with Jepack Compose

## Prerequisites
Users must use their own TMDB Api key. The Api key must be inserted to its reserved slot in MovieViewModel.kt.
