            <h3>About the site(site construction in progress)</h3>
             <p>This site was build as a practice assignment for the course Basics of Web Development. The purpose was to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web site
                with a dedicated backend running on the cloud. The purpose of this site is to link together some web-sites providing tutorials or courses on JavaScript programming language, and
                to provide a browser based code runner for JavaScript code. The site is deployed using Firebase Hosting. The server was originally built using Node.js Express framework
                , and it was later modified to work as a Firebase Function. For website/serverside files, see GitHub repositories under the Resources tab. The line numbering and syntax highlighting of the code editor are
                provided by CodeMirror, and were fetched from a content delivery network on Cloudflare. Some external sites, with tutorials for learning JavaScript programming, can be
                found under the Learning tab.</p>
            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>My name is Juho Hietala. I'm a second year ICT engineering student at Oulu University of Applied Sciences and I major in software development. This site is a part
                of my online GitHub portfolio. </p>
