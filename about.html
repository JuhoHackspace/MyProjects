                <h3>About the site(site construction in progress)</h3>
                <p>This site was build as a practice assignment for the course Basics of Web Development. The purpose was to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web site
                with a dedicated backend running on the cloud. The purpose of this site is to link together some web-sites providing tutorials or courses on JavaScript programming language, and
                to provide a browser based code runner for JavaScript code. The code runner was built by deploying a Node.js Express backend on Render.com to execute the code
                    sent as a HTTP request from the code runner. The line numbering and syntax highlighting of the code editor are provided by CodeMirror, and were fetched
                    from an open data service on cloudflare (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/codemirror/5.62.0). Some tutorials for learning JavaScript programming can be
                    found under the Learning tab.</p>
                <h3>About me</h3>

                    of my online GitHub portfolio. </p>
