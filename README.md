# MyProjects

**The repository [MyProjects](https://github.com/JuhoHackspace/MyProjects.git) contains some of my school/personal programming projects, and is a part of my online programming portfolio.**

Im a third year ICT engineering student at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. I study software development.
