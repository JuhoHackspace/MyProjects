In this repository there are two school application projects done under the ICT engineering degree programme:
+ First year IT application project **Project Theremin 2.0**
+ First year Software development application project **Bank-automat**

More school projects and assignments will be added as I progress in my studies. Some personal projects will hopefully also find their way here.
