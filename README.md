# MyProjects

**The repository [MyProjects](https://github.com/JuhoHackspace/MyProjects.git) contains some of my school/personal programming projects, and is a part of my online programming portfolio.**

Im a second year ICT engineering student at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. I study software development.

In this repository there are three school application projects done under the ICT engineering degree programme:
+ First year IT application project **Project Theremin 2.0**
+ First year Software development application project **Bank-automat**
+ Second year Web development application project **Muuvit**

Other school projects:

More school projects and assignments will be added as I progress in my studies. Some personal projects will hopefully also find their way here.
