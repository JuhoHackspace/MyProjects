                    <h3>About the site</h3>
                    <p>This site was build as a practice assignment for the course Basics of Web Development. The purpose was to demonstrate my skills in building a responsive web site
                        with a dedicated backend running in the cloud. The purpose of this site is to link together some web-sites providing tutorials or courses on JavaScript programming language, and
                        to provide a browser based code runner for JavaScript code. Some programming quizes were added as an additional feature.
                        The site is deployed using Firebase Hosting. The server was originally built using Node.js Express framework,
                        and it was later modified to work as a Firebase Function. For website/serverside files, see GitHub repositories under the Resources tab. The line numbering and syntax highlighting of the code editor were
                        provided by CodeMirror, and were fetched from a content delivery network on Cloudflare. Some external sites, with tutorials for learning JavaScript programming, can be
                        found under the Learning tab.</p>

                        of my online GitHub portfolio. </p>
